This repository contains the training code, the test code and the datasets relevant to Doodle Detectives hackathon conducted by the AI Club IITM
# Doodle Detectives, AI Club, IITM | Computer Vision Hackathon | 
# AI-based recognizer to find accurate labels in the noisy Quick Draw dataset by Google 
1. Implemented a custom encoder of U-Net with feedforward neural network to classify the images in one of 101 labels
2. Operated on a dataset with 430,000 doodles and used cross-entropy loss to train the weights of the neural network
3. Achieved a Mean Reciprocal Rank at 3(MRR@3) of 0.666 and the score is in top 5 submissions made in the hackathon
